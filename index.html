      <p class="intro-text">
        Hello! I am a professional software engineer that specializes in designing and developing full-stack software
        applications. I have worked
        using several different tech stacks including TypeScript and React as well as Java Spring Boot and Vue. This
        portfolio showcases some projects enhanced as part of CS-499 as well as work I have completed throughout my
        computer science program.

      <p class="intro-text">
        Before starting the computer science program, I had been programming and creating websites for several years as
        a hobby and got a job as a frontend developer using React. While working on this job, I realized that I lacked
        the knowledge of computer science fundamentals. While I was good at web development, I realized that this
        comprised only a small part of being a software engineer, and I needed to broaden my understand and deepen my
        skillset.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p class="intro-text">
        During my time in the computer science program, I have been able to improve my computer science understanding
        skills and
        learn a much more diverse skillset. I have used the skills I've gained to go from a frontend developer only
        using
        React to a complete full-stack software engineer using Java, Postgres, and Vue. Several specific parts of this
        program helped me advance in this way. First, the math courses gave me a much stronger understanding and
        fundamental background for understanding more difficult concepts such as set theory and boolean logic. When
        encountering new problems at work, I was able to use this understand to learn faster. Second, the data
        structures and algorithms class gave me a much deeper insight into how programming works and dramatically
        improved my coding choices. Finally, the program exposed me to a wide variety of different languages and
        technologies I wouldn't have originally tried before such as Android Development with Java and software security
        using C++. Additionally, I was able to learn more about databases and designing systems and software using
        models.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p class="intro-text">
        An essential skill that sets accomplished software engineers apart from mere programmers is the ability to
        collaborate in a team and work with stakeholders to solve loosly defined problems. As part of my computer
        science training and real life experience, I have learned that these soft skills are just as important as
        technical ability. I focus my efforts on creating code that benefits the team in the long-term rather than
        rushing code to solve solutions now. Taking the time to throughoughly test and review your code as well as make
        the right choices helps other developers on the team, and it sets the project up for long term success several
        years down the road. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with several customers, designers,
        and other developers to come up with creative solutions to difficult problems. In these cases it isn't exactly
        obvious what needs to be done, and it is only through working together that a good solution that benefits both
        users and works well with the existing code base can be found.

        The next section showcases some artifacts that I have enhanced as part of CS-499 that showcase several different
        areas of my technical abilities. There are three projects: one that showcases software development and design,
        one that showcases data structures and algorithms, and one that showcases databases. Together, these portfolio
        artifacts demonstrate a broad understanding and varied computer science skillset that can achieve in any domain.
