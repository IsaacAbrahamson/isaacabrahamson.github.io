      <h1 class="page-title">Worship Manager API</h1>
      <p class="page-text">A REST API and database used to manage worship services. This was creating using Java,
        Hibernate ORM, and Postgres and demonstrates my abilities using databases and ORMs.</p>

        <h2 class="page-heading">Overview</h2>
        <p class="page-text">My artifact is a REST API that uses Java, Spring Data JPA, and the Postgres database. I
          originally created a
          CRUD application called Worship Manager that organized a grouping of services with related events, songs, and
          people. I originally created this using TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-group">
        <h2 class="page-heading">Justification and Enhancement</h2>
        <p class="page-text">I believe this is a good artifact for the ePortfolio database category, because it
          showcases both the creation and management of a Postgres database, using an ORM with the Jakarta Persistence
          API (JPA) for a SQL database, and finally how to incorporate a database into a REST API. To improve this, I
          took the original idea from the MongoDB database, and I created the postgres database and Java REST API out of
          that.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-group">
        <h2 class="page-heading">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="page-text">There were several challenges trying to replicate my entire Express backend with the new
          Java REST API. The application was already structured with authentication baked into all the routes and tied
          to the frontend. To implement this in the Java backend ended up being extremely tedious and difficult, so I
          didnâ€™t add the authentication part to this API as it isnâ€™t really required for this database artifact. I
          learned two valuable things from this. First, I learned that it is a lot harder to reverse engineer an
          application that is already being used than to build it from scratch. Because the frontend was already
          configured to work with authentication and endpoints a certain way, it was really hard to make the new backend
          how I wanted. Second, I learned that there was a lot more about authentication in Java that I needed to learn.
          I work on a large Java project that already has Spring security well implemented throughout, so authenticating
          routes is as simple as adding a few annotations. Trying to set this up from the ground up was a lot harder
          than I expected, so I plan on looking into that later after this course.</p>
