        events, people, and songs that happen in a worship service. Please note, this dashboard is currently not
        intended to be used by mobile devices</p>

        <h2 class="page-heading">The Idea</h2>
        <p class="page-text">The idea for this project is based on a project that I initially built for a
          Database Systems
          class in college. In that class, I designed a MySQL database to solve the need of storing worship service
          information. The MySQL database was complete with an ERD, functions, and stored procedures. However, since the
          project was for a database class, the user
          interface that I built was mostly an after-thought as shown below:</p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="../media/bandmanager.png" alt="Picture of original band manager app">
        </div>
        <p class="page-text">I was going to remake the user
          interface, but I realized that I could take the
          same
          concept and make a much more polished and fully-featured web app if I started from scratch using new tools
          that I had learned. Worship Manager is
          the evolution of this idea: a fully-featured SPA using React and TypeScript, and an Express.js REST API for
          the server.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-group">
        <h2 class="page-heading">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="page-text">When first visiting the site, the user is redirected to the login and register page. The
          user can create an account with an email, password, and name. </p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="../media/worship/login.jpg" alt="Picture of worship manager app login">
        </div>
        <p class="page-text">After logging in, the user will be redirected to the services page where they can see all
          of their past and upcoming services. The user will automatically be given three upcoming and past services
          with example data.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="../media/wm.jpg" alt="Picture of worship manager app services page">
        </div>
        <p class="page-text">The user can click the "New Service" button on the top right to create a new service, or
          click any service to go to its detail page shown below. This detail page contains a list of all of the events
          and people who participated in the service.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="../media/worship/detail.jpg" alt="Picture of worship manager service detail page">
        </div>
        <p class="page-text">The user can also add an event or person to the service using the drop downs under each
          table. The cool thing about these dropdowns is that they pull in all of the data from the other parts of the
          application. For example, when the user selects a new person to add, all of the names in the dropdown are
          pulled from the "People" page.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="../media/worship/dropdown.jpg" alt="Picture of worship manager service detail page dropdown.">
        </div>
        <p class="page-text">The user can view and edit all of the available songs and people using the Songs and People
          pages on the left sidebar.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="../media/worship/people.jpg" alt="Picture of worship manager people page.">
        </div>
        <p class="page-text">The user can also edit all of the available service types, event types, and roles using the
          Options page.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="../media/worship/options.jpg" alt="Picture of worship manager options page.">
        </div>
        <p class="page-text">Existing services, people, and options can also be edited using a pop-up modal:</p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="../media/worship/modal.jpg" alt="Picture of worship manager modal.">
        </div>
        <p class="page-text">Together, all of these features create a flexible dashboard application that can easily
          track
          and manage worship services.</p>
