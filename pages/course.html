      <p class="page-text">A command line application for viewing and searching courses and their requirements using
        different data structures. This artifact was created using C++ and demonstrates my abilities in data
        structures and algorithms.</p>

        <h2 class="page-heading">Overview</h2>
        <p class="page-text">This is a command line application I built for the CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms
          class. It contains a simple application to load a list of courses from a file into a data structure and then
          print the whole list as well as specific courses and their perquisites.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-group">
        <h2 class="page-heading">Justification and Enhancement</h2>
        <p class="page-text">I selected this item because it shows how to use several different data structures to
          accomplish the same task. Additionally, it also shows the creation of a complex data structure from scratch
          with the Binary Search Tree. For this assignment, I made several improvements. My first improvement was to
          take some of the description from a word file into the project readme. My next improvement was to improve the
          sample data from about 10 courses to 200. My next improvement was to add timings to the method calls so the
          difference could be seen between the chosen data structure. My next improvement was adding vector and hash
          table data structures in addition to the binary search tree that could be chosen from. Finally, the addition
          of the extra data structures made the code pretty complex, so I created an abstract structure class that all
          three data structures implemented so that the one course menu could be greatly simplified and it uses the
          abstract methods based on whichever structure the user chooses at runtime.</p>

        <h2 class="page-heading">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="page-text">The hardest part of this improvement was working with C++ again. It has many features, but
          a lot of the language is just so different and weird to use compared to programming languages I am more
          familiar with. As an example, when I wanted to create the interface to use, it was tricky to figure this out
          because C++ doesnâ€™t have interfaces. I had to create an abstract class and then figure out how to use all
          those virtual methods in the classes themselves. Throughout this process, I got some more experience using C++
          and also remembered some of the basics of these different data structures.</p>
